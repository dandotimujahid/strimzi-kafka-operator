= Troubleshooting and refreshing rebalances

[role="_abstract"]
When creating a `KafkaRebalance` resource or interacting with Cruise Control, errors are reported in the resource status, along with guidance on how to fix them.
In such cases, the resource transitions to the `NotReady` state.

To continue with a cluster rebalance operation, you must rectify any configuration issues in the `KafkaRebalance` resource or address any problems with the Cruise Control deployment. 

Common issues include the following:

* Misconfigured parameters in the `KafkaRebalance` resource.
* The `strimzi.io/cluster` label for specifying the Kafka cluster in the `KafkaRebalance` resource is missing.
* The Cruise Control server is not deployed as the `cruiseControl` property in the `Kafka` resource is missing.
* The Cruise Control server is not reachable.

After fixing any issues, you need to add the `refresh` annotation to the `KafkaRebalance` resource.
During a “refresh”, a new optimization proposal is requested from the Cruise Control server.

.Prerequisites

* You have xref:proc-approving-optimization-proposal-{context}[approved an optimization proposal].

* The status of the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource for the rebalance operation is `NotReady`.

.Procedure

. Get information about the error from the `KafkaRebalance` status:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl describe kafkarebalance _rebalance-cr-name_
----

. Attempt to resolve the issue in the `KafkaRebalance` resource.

. Annotate the `KafkaRebalance` resource in Kubernetes:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl annotate kafkarebalance _rebalance-cr-name_ strimzi.io/rebalance="refresh"
----

. Check the status of the `KafkaRebalance` resource:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl describe kafkarebalance _rebalance-cr-name_
----

. Wait until the status changes to `PendingProposal`, or directly to `ProposalReady`.
